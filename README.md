# Monte-carlo-Methods
Python script for course methods

This repository contains some algorithm implemented for the M2MO course : Monte Carlo : https://masterfinance.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/index.php/formation/liste-des-cours/cours-methodes-numeriques/173-methodes-de-monte-carlo-2


  - Simulation.py : The first script made on this course contains usual simulations methods for random variables or stochastic process using only the randomness of a uniform random variable    
  
  - VarianceReduction.py : this second script consists in computing the price of a payoff with two estimator : first law of large number and then using variance reduction by importance sampling and affine translation and then comparing bith results

  - Project folder contain the project done in order to validate this course, project is on the parametrix method.It's a rather recent simulation technic that is unbiased.
